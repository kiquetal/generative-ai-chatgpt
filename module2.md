#### The RADAR framework

R-equirements
Begin with the flipped interaction pattern where the AI interviews
you tou undersand needs and requirements.

A-rchitecture
After gathering sufficient information, have the AI propose multiple schema options with trade-off explained

D-ata
Before building anything, have the AI generate simulated data based on your
requirements to test different schema options

A-nalysis
TEst the prosposed schemas by asking the AI to generate simple queries for your
most important wquestions against the simulated data

R-efinement
Return to th einterview stage with more targeted questions based on what you
learned from testing

### Gap Analysis

List some things we might want to k now that we can't answer with the current
structure but that would likely be easy to fix with simple tweaks.

G:ap identification

Ask the AI to idenfity questions your current schema cannot answer efficiently

A:nalyis of limitations

Have the AI explain why each limitation exists in technical terms

P:roposed solutions

Get specific recommendations for schema modifications to adress each gap.

S:olution implementation & simulation

Implement the changes and simulate queries to verify the gaprs are resolved.
